that is a link to how to use YOLO as an object detection method in openCV

Yolo is good because it is computationally a lot faster than tensor flow and is easier to set up

It is primarily meant for streaming purposes 

YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in real-time. 
As the name suggests, the algorithm requires only a single forward propagation through a neural network to detect objects.
